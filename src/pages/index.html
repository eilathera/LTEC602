        <p>Gamification is a very widely used and general term that blankets a variety of game types, structures, and delivery. However, for we will be focusing on the basic delivery types of gamification in the classroom.</p>
        <p>There are two type of delivery options when it comes to educational gamification. One and probably easier of the two is the physical delivery of instruction through a physical type of game. (i.e board games, card games, etc.) The second type of
            gamification in education is through technology based delivery. These include games that run through computers, mobile devices, and game consoles.</p>
        <p>For the sake of this website we will be focusing on the technology based gamification. Below are some of the pros and cons about gamification in the classroom. </p>

            <p>How we learn… There are three main learning styles that children show preference towards. Although, most students will be have tendencies in all three areas, we all have a dominant style that we gravitate towards. The three learning styles
                are as followed:

                <hr>
                <p>Visual learners prefer using pictures, images, colors, and maps to organize information and communicate with others. These learners use visuals to process information. According to EducationPlanner.org here are some things that visual
                    learners can do to learn better:</p>
                <ul>
                    <ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sit near the front of the classroom. (It won't mean you're the teacher's pet!)</li>
                            <li>Have your eyesight checked on a regular basis</li>
                            <li>Use flashcards to learn new words</li>
                            <li>Try to visualize things that you hear or things that are read to you</li>
                            <li>Write down key words, ideas, or instructions</li>
                            <li>Draw pictures to help explain new concepts and then explain the pictures</li>
                            <li>Color code things</li>
                            <li>Avoid distractions during study times</li>
                        </ul>

                <h3>Auditory</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Auditory learners prefer learning through listening and hearing information. Auditory learners do better when instructions are read aloud rather than having to read written ones. Here are some things that will help auditory learners to
                    learn better:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sit where you can hear</li>
                            <li>Have your hearing checked on a regular basis</li>
                            <li>Use flashcards to learn new words; read them out loud</li>
                            <li>Read stories, assignments, or directions out loud</li>
                            <li>Record yourself spelling words and then listen to the recording</li>
                            <li>Have test questions read to you out loud</li>
                            <li>Study new material by reading it out loud</li>

                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                </div>
                <h3>Tactile</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Tactile learners are those that learn best through touching and doing activities. These learners are the “hands on” learners and learn best when there are physical activities that help them understand concepts. These learners typically
                    have difficulty attending to visual and auditory learner settings. Here are some pointers that will help tactile learners to learn better:</p>
                <ul>
                    <ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Participate in activities that involve touching, building, moving, or drawing</li>
                            <li>Do lots of hands-on activities like completing art projects, taking walks, or acting out stories</li>
                            <li>It's OK to chew gum, walk around, or rock in a chair while reading or studying</li>
                            <li>Use flashcards and arrange them in groups to show relationships between ideas</li>
                            <li>Trace words with your finger to learn spelling (finger spelling)</li>
                            <li>Take frequent breaks during reading or studying periods (frequent, but not long)</li>
                            <li>It's OK to tap a pencil, shake your foot, or hold on to something while learning</li>
                            <li>Use a computer to reinforce learning through the sense of touch</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

        <h3 id="Education">General Education Students</h3>
        <p>General education students all have different way of learning. These student rely heavily on the teacher's ability to differentiate each lesson so that all students, regardless of ability, can understand the concept. This task is one that many,
            if not all teachers struggle with. One way that general education teachers ensure that they are hitting all learner areas, is through time tedious lesson planning and material creation. Although, very time consuming teachers invest time and
            effort to make visuals and plan activities that will be interesting to students. A drawback of this, is there is no way of editing these materials from year to year. VIsual may get outdated or students interests might shift making examples
            irrelevant.
        </p>
        <p>One thing that technology integration does is make the teacher process of planning a lot shorter and more efficient. Technology, more specifically gamification, is a teaching style in itself. Teachers are able to hit all three learning styles
            through this medium of teaching. Gamification will also allow students interact with activities, work in groups, discuss topics, and increase workplace readiness skills. On top of those benefits teachers also have peace of mind that lessons
            can be tweaked or changes very easily.</p>

        <h3>Special Education Students</h3>

        <p>Special education students also have many different ways of learning. These students most times do need more intensive assistance when learning due to their disabilities. The use of the IEP or individualized instruction program outlines specific
            things that teacher need to hit to ensure continued progress in all areas of development. (academic readiness, gross motor, fine motor, self-help, adaptive, social, etc.) Teachers in special education have to plan lessons that hit and benefit
            all students in their own specific learning needs and styles. Most time special education teachers will plan and create individualized lesson for each student focusing on their own needs. This can be very time consuming especially with some
            classes sizes ranging from 4-12 students/caseloads.</p>
        <p>One thing that technology integration does here is again making the teacher process a lot more efficient. The use of gamification in specific will help teachers make lesson that are engaging and appeal to all students and their disabilities. These
            technology based lessons will be easily editable making it very simple to modify content, and difficulty for each students personalize needs.</p>
